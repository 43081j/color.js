# Color manipulation

## By color coordinates

We've seen in the [previous section](the-color-object) how we can manipulate a color
by directly manipulating coordinates in any of the color spaces supported.
LCH coordinates are particularly useful for this so they are available directly on color objects:

```js
let color = new Color("rebeccapurple");
let color = new Color("rebeccapurple");
color.lightness *= 1.2;
color.chroma = 40;
color.hue += 30;
```

You can also use `color.set()` to set multiple coordinates at once.
In addition, it returns the color itself, so further methods can be called on it:

```js
let color = new Color("lch(50% 50 10)");
color = color.set({
	hue: h => h + 180, // relative modification!
	chroma: 60,
	"hwb.whiteness": w => w * 1.2
}).lighten();
```

## Gamut mapping

[Color Gamut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamut) is the range of colors a given color space can produce.
Some color spaces (e.g. Lab, LCH, Ja<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub>, CAM16) are mathematical models that encompass all visible color.
Others however cannot produce all visible color without *values out of range*.
For example. all the RGB spaces (sRGB, P3, AdobeÂ® RGB, ProPhoto, REC.2020) have a gamut that is smaller than all visible color.
Therefore, there are colors that are perfectly normal, but cannot be represented by certain color spaces.
For example, the P3 lime (`color(display-p3 0 1 0)`) is outside of the gamut of sRGB.
In addition, colors that are **not visible to humans** can sometimes be represented by some color spaces!
Most notably, two of ProPhoto's three primaries (pure green, pure blue) are **outside the gamut of human vision**!

The process of transforming a color outside of a given gamut to a color that is as close as possible but is *inside gamut* is called *gamut mapping* and is the subject of [entire books](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Color_Gamut_Mapping/Yy0uK3pvfRMC?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover).

So how does Color.js handle all this?

**Color.js does not do gamut mapping by default**, as this is lossy: If you convert from a larger color space to a smaller one and then back, you need to be able to get your original color (possibly with some roundoff error due to the calculations).

You can call `color.inGamut()` to check if the current color is in gamut of its own color space, or you can pass a different color space to check against:

```js
let lime = new Color("p3", [0, 1, 0]);
lime.inGamut();
lime.inGamut("srgb");
let sRGB_lime = lime.to("srgb");
sRGB_lime.inGamut();
```

Note that while the coordinates remain unchanged, the string representation of a Color object is after gamut mapping, unless you explicitly turn that off:

```js
let lime = new Color("p3", [0, 1, 0]).to("srgb");
lime.coords;
lime.toString();
lime.toString({inGamut: false});
```


If you want gamut mapped coordinates, you can use `color.toGamut()`, which by default returns a new color that is within gamut (if you want to mutate your own color instead you can use `{inPlace: true}`).
You can also pass a different color space whose gamut you are mapping to via the `space` parameter.

```js
let lime = new Color("p3", [0, 1, 0]);
let sRGB_lime = lime.to("srgb");
lime.toGamut({space: "srgb"});
sRGB_lime.toGamut();
```

Perhaps most important is the `method` parameter, which controls the algorithm used for gamut mapping.
You can pass `"clip"` to use simple clipping (not recommended), or any coordinate of any imported color space, which will make Color.js reduce that coordinate until the color is in gamut.
The default method is `"lch.chroma"` which means LCH hue and lightness remain constant while chroma is reduced until the color fits in gamut.
This tends to produce good results for most colors, but most notably fails on yellows:

```js
let P3_yellow = new Color("p3", [1, 1, 0]);
let sRGB_yellow = P3_yellow.to("srgb");
sRGB_yellow.toGamut();
sRGB_yellow.toGamut({method: "clip"});
sRGB_yellow.toGamut({method: "hsl.saturation"});
```
