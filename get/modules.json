			"description": "A CIE color space with good perceptually uniformity, Lab has a central Lightness axis (black at 0, white at 100, mid-grey at 50) and two opponent color axes. The a axis has pinkish reds in the positive direction and the complementary bluish-greens in the negative direction. The b axis has yellows in the positive direction and the complementary blue-violets in the negative direction. The geometric distance between to points in Lab is a good first approximation to how different the two colors look. Commercial color-measuring instruments report values in Lab, and it is used as an intermediate space for gamut mapping and colorspace interconversion."

Designed to avoid hue shifts when sigmoid (contrast-changing) functions are applied directly to the RGB channels, so it is popular as an authoring space for digital photography. Includes 90% of visible colors, but also encodes many values that are not physically realizable colors. Requires gamut mapping before display."
